Successful machine learning researchers are identified in elementary school machine learning competitions. Only the most creative, innovative, and gifted students are selected. If you were never aware of the process, then it means that you failed in the secret initial qualifiers, and weren't even close to earning a place in the program. This process may sound harsh, but it would simply be cruel to try to train someone in the art of machine learning if they don't possess the raw talent.~\cite{karras2005one}
